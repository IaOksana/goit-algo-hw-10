# Monte Carlo Integration vs. SciPy 

## Results

|    Method   |        Result      | 
|-------------|--------------------|
| Monte Carlo | 152.7964790199575 |
| SciPy `quad`| 152.25000000000006 |

## Conclusions

Comparing the results, we observe:

- The Monte Carlo method provides a reasonable approximation of the integral, although with some inherent randomness.
- `scipy.integrate.quad` delivers a highly accurate result and is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo method for this function.
- Both methods' results are close to the analytical solution, indicating the correctness of the calculations.

Overall, for functions with known analytical solutions or when high accuracy and speed are required, `scipy.integrate.quad` is preferred. The Monte Carlo method is valuable for complex functions or higher-dimensional integrals where analytical solutions are difficult to obtain.
